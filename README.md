**Project Title: Student Management System**
**
Description:**
The Student Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL that enables educational institutions to efficiently manage student and academic data. This system provides an organized interface for administrators, faculty, and students to interact with core academic operations such as student records, attendance tracking, mark recording, subject and department management, and more.

**The application includes the following key functionalities:**

Role-based Access:
Users can log in as administrators, faculty, or students, each with appropriate access and permissions.

Student Records Management:
Administrators can add, edit, view, and delete student details stored in the database.

Academic Management:
The system supports adding and managing subjects, departments, and faculty members.

Attendance and Marks Recording:
Faculty users can mark student attendance and record academic marks for evaluations.

Structured Navigation and UI:
The user interface enables intuitive navigation through dashboards, forms, and lists for seamless interaction.

Report Generation:
The system includes PDF generation and display features to create printable student and academic reports.

The application uses a MySQL database for persistent storage and follows a modular structure with separate PHP files for CRUD operations, authentication, dashboards, and scripts. This system aims to automate manual data handling, reduce administrative workload, and provide a centralized management platform for student data.
